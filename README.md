# Boxes

A feature that Firefox lacks is the ability to easily switch between different profiles. The default method of going to `about:profiles` can also feel very hacky.

Boxes provides a clean interface to manage all of this, and at the same time also provides the ability to manage profiles across Firefox version (Normal Edition, Developer Edition, Nightly Edition).

Boxes is composed of many interlocking components, so this repository is a wrapper/installer around all of them.
